## Modified Power Wheels Car

Through the club on campus Make it Happen, I started working on a project for two kids with muscle distrophy. They loved riding around in power wheels cars, but their condition didn't allow them to do it safetly or comfortably. I worked with three other people on this project while getting input from the parents. 

This project went on way longer than we were hoping due to incompatible schedules, problems with online communication, and the general lack of experience and organization our team had. To get this project done and done well, we all had to step up even though we were busy. That included coming in during finals week to finish it before school ended. 

It was an interesting challenge to modify a car for specific needs. We ended up using a variety of techniques including 3D printing, sewing, woodworking, and "take it apart and hope for the best."
