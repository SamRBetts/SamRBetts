# About me

---

**Welcome!** I'm Sam Betts, a Mechanical Engineering major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with aspiring in minors in Robotics, German, Astronomy, and a concentration in Aerospace.

## Future Plans
My gaol is to have a career in the aerospace industry; I would preferably work on satellites or robotic deep space missions. I plan to continue my pursuit of aerospace-based projects through Rose Rocketry with the goal of creating a CubeSat by next year.

## Other information
I participate in clubs on campus like Rose Rocketry, Astronomy Club, Design Build Fly, and Rose Symphony Orchestra

In my free time, I take care of my dog, Ryker, and stare at the stars.
